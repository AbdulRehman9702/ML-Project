. Built a machine learning pipeline to predict student performance with 89% accuracy using Scikit-learn.  
. Performed data collection, preprocessing, and feature engineering to prepare robust datasets for model training.  
. Utilized DVC for data version control and MLflow for experiment tracking, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.  
. Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning and evaluation metrics analysis.
